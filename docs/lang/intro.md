# The Helios language

The Helios language is a purely functional programming language, with a simple curly braces syntax. It is inspired by [Go](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Tenets

- Readability is more important than writeability
- Easily auditable, it should be easy to spot malicious code
- Opinionated, there should be only one obvious way of doing things
